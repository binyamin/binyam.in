## Emails are not websites
Pictures, buttons, and borders are often a bad idea, as they makes you look more branded and less personal.
Some good examples are James Clear's and David Perell's Newsletters. David Perell uses pictures very effectively.

## Try not to track clicks
Let the user know the url of links, so they don't need to blindly trust that it leads to a safe site.
A good compromise is to indicate the website on which the article can be found. [Frontend Focus](frontendfoc.us) puts the website in a `title` html attribute on their links.
## Emails are letters
Most of the newsletters I actually read, start with a greeting and end with the sender's name. You don't need the subscriber's name to talk directly to their heart.
In one episode of [SyntaxFm](syntax.fm), Wes Bos (or was it Scott Tolinski (?)) said that he literally opens up Gmail every time he writes a promotional email. People like it when _other people_ connect with them.

## Admit yourself
When you deliberately make yourself vulnerable, you build others' trust and confidence.
In one issue of his newsletter,[Cullin McGrath](https://cullinm.com) revealed his subscriber count. Although it seemed like a small number to me, I knew he was legit. He wasn't reaching for praise; he simply wanted to share ideas and opinions.

## Emails are not blog posts
Keep it short.

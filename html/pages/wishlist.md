# Wishlist

{% callout "info" %}
I prefer to save towards more expensive products, rather than receive similar items of lesser quality. I appreciate $25 towards a $125 item.
{% endcallout %}

## Tech

* Comfortable desk chair, for daily use. Not much of a preference.
* A portable monitor would be handy when I'm not at home. I like the [Lepow 15.6” HD Portable Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V1SQ966) ($188.98).
* I'd like a Raspberry Pi ([what?](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/)) to play around with. [This starter kit](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-4B-Essentials-Beginners/dp/B08KQBBX1W/) ($96) has everything I need, at a relatively reasonable price. (For techies, it's a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB)

## Books

* [The Hirsch Chumash](https://www.feldheim.com/the-hirsch-chumash-complete-set.html) ($200) - Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch's classic torah commentary
* Rambam’s Mishnah Torah ([Frankel Edition](https://shabsifrankel.com/collections/custom-collection/products/yad-shabsi-condensed-edition) - $116)
* ["Refractoring UI" (e-book)](https://refactoringui.com/book) ($79) - Design good-looking websites and apps.
* See [my reading list](/reading#future) for a bunch of cheaper options.

## Other

* [Ryan Tedder's songwriting course](https://monthly.com/ryan-tedder-songwriting?friend=moshe-siegel) ($279)
* [Teeturtle](https://www.teeturtle.com/) sells some very fun t-shirts for geeks. ($25, $12.50 on-sale)
* Paracord bracelet ([walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Deluxe-Paracord-Survival-Bracelet/49676108) - $7.25, [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XK9MF1F) - $6.97)

{% callout info %}
I originally wrote this around March 12, 2020. I forgot about it until recently.
{% endcallout %}

Here, I subtly introduce you to the topic at hand, and grab your attention. I may use fantastic words and extravagant linguistics, or I can just be really boring and stuff. That's called an **introduction**. Use it.

Now, I start to get into the _nitty-gritty_ of the article. I may include some cool things like {%raw%}`{% liquid:tags %}`{% endraw %} inline code.

```js
document.before('codeBlock', () => {
  do("explain with words");
})
```

Now, I write another paragraph. Write at least two **body** paragraphs, with at least three sentences each. Use proper grammar, ~~ppl~~ people!

Lastly, I leave you with a thought which will remind you of what I've written. It's called a **conclusion**, and it's like a party favor or gift. It leaves the reader with a good impression. Think of it as a nice way of saying, _goodbye_.

When a project has a *public channel* for issues/tickets and pull/merge requests, and someone randomly submits a patch for that software.

Be aware, that there's a good chance they're thinking, "I want to get involved with this project. I want to help it grow. I want to make it shine."

So, every week you don't review it, you lose a brownie point. And every time _someone else_ realizes you didn't respond yet, you lose another one.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

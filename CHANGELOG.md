# Changelog for this site

Note: This changelog begins at v4.2.0, since that's when I decided to start keeping it.
<!-- Write that what AND why, in order to track my thought process throughout development, and not revert changes left and right. -->

## 4.2.0 - 01-04-2021
- Added this changelog, in order to track my thought process and make better design decisions in the future
- removed hashtags from posts (visibly). I don't have enough posts for it to be important. Now, it just takes up space.
- inline code is now dark-grey instead of red, since the red color disrupted the flow of reading.
- stopped processing "#foo" as a hashtag-link. The links don't lead anywhere except a 404.

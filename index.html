		<h1>About</h1>
		<article class="about-text">
			<p><span>If</span> you've come to this section, I assume you're wondering what I actually do. Well, as you probably figured from the call-out on my home page, I primarily create websites and web applications. I also design websites, as well as logos, posters and business cards. BTW, I love to chat, so drop me a note below!</p>
			<p><span>But</span> why should you use from me? What can I do for you? For starters, I can give you the time and care you need to grow your business. Just read the case study on my portfolio page! Additionally, you are helping others. You're giving me the experience which will enable me to give others the best service possible. Who doesn't want to  help a friend in need? We are not a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, though. Sorry, no tax breaks.</p>
			<p><span>If</span> you've read this far, I assume you are actually looking to know "About Me". My name is Binyamin Aron Green, and I live in Baltimore, MD. I'm 20 years old, and I currently am enrolled in CCBC, or Community College of Baltimore County. My interests include computer programming (obviously), music and reading. I learned my design skills primarily through youtube tutorials. Youtube is a great place to learn things you never knew you wanted to know. Alternatively, you can do what I did with programming, and use websites like Kahn Academy, FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy. They are all free, and I highly recommend each of them.</p>

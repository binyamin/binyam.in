**\[Verse 1]**

Heart beats fast\
Colors and promises\
How to be brave?\
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall\
But watching you stand alone?\
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow\
One step closer

**\[Chorus]**

I have died everyday waiting for you\
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you\
For a thousand years\
I'll love you for a thousand more

**\[Verse 2]**

Time stands still\
Beauty in all she is\
I will be brave\
I will not let anything take away\
What's standing in front of me\
Every breath\
Every hour has come to this\
One step closer



**\[Chorus]**

**\[Bridge]**

And all along I believed I would find you\
Time has brought your heart to me\
I have loved you for a thousand years\
I'll love you for a thousand more\
One step closer\
One step closer

**\[Chorus]**

**\[Outro]**

And all along I believed I would find you\
Time has brought your heart to me\
I have loved you for a thousand years\
I'll love you for a thousand more

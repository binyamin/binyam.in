# Garden Guide
_This page is adapted from and inspired by Shawn Wang's ["Digital Garden Terms of Service"](https://www.swyx.io/writing/digital-garden-tos)_

Welcome! You are now browsing a [[Digital Garden]]. This is my personal space for [learning In public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). I am a lifelong learner, so everything here is a Work-In-Progress (like me), and I do not let perfectionism get in the way. **Nothing here is authoritative or complete, nor is it representative of my best work.**

However, it *is* representative of my interests, and the current state of my knowledge. If you have the same interests, then this space is also yours to use as a reference. Feedback and social sharing is welcome - that is the whole point of being public!

## Right to Be Wrong
I have a right to be wrong or incomplete in my Digital Garden, either due to lack of time or knowledge. You will not hold this, or my readership, against me because I will keep learning, with your help. Everything in the Digital Garden is a living document and I will retract or rephrase things I no longer agree with.

## Constructive Criticism
You are expressly welcome to comment on, tear apart, counter-argue, or otherwise disagree with anything here. No compliments needed. I will listen to you but I don't promise to agree with you.

Please also suggest what else I should include, read, watch, or listen to, or tell me what you would have written instead. Better yet, write a better version of what I did and publish it on your own garden. I'd love to read it.

## Attribute, don't Plagiarize
Please don't plagiarize. You're welcome to quote, with attribution and a link back here. I don't waive copyright for commercial purposes. But feel free to share ideas and riff off of them.

At the beginning of 2020, after seeing a Goodreads challenge, I decided to read twelve books that year. And I did read some wonderful books and novels. In [_Norse Mythology_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37903770-norse-mythology), Neil Gaiman paints a pretty picture of the Norse pantheon. [_Letters to a Young Writer_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31868169-letters-to-a-young-writer), by Colum McCann, advises young writers on how to hone their craft, and itself exhibits excellent writing.

## The Problem
While I loved what I read, I only completed seven out of the twelve I had planned to read. Initially, I was disappointed that I didn't meet my goal. Reading one book each month should not have been hard for me to do. Why couldn't I have just _read more_?

Looking back, I find that I didn't want to rush through any books. In order to read a 300-page book in one month, I would need to do at least ten pages per day. That's great for fiction or light-reading. But some of the books I had lined-up were full of information which needed processing. My system was faulty.


## A New Goal
If I'm going to up my reading game in 2021, I need to devise a different challenge. I could separate my books into light-reading and heavy-reading. Or maybe my goal was fine, and I need to widen my selection of books.

As I write this, I realize that the issue is about my _choice_ of books. You see, there are a couple things I'd like to accomplish by reading. I want to take an emotional journey through a fabricated world. I'd also like to learn more about certain concepts and ideas. To me, this distinction is similar to that of fiction versus non-fiction.

**Here's my new goal**: I'd like to read ten books this year. Of those ten, four must be novels or light-reading. The remaining six are be up to me.

## Parting Thoughts

Honestly, though, every book can be a novel. Every book should be a journey, broken into both logical and emotionally-provoking sections. How else did Lin Manuel-Miranda transform a scholarly work into the acclaimed broadway musical, _Hamilton_? You don't need to be a writer to tell stories, but you should tell a story when you write.

<q cite="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">URIs don't change: people change them.</q> That's what [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) says, either way. I was reading his article ["Cool URIs don't change"](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html), and I started thinking about my own website. I recently implemented [a micro blog](/c/micro), and it's possible that I will want more kinds of posts in the future.

That's the answer, I realized! They're all _posts_, each with a different _category_. I decided to construct these categories using the Indieweb's concept of a [**post type**](https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts). I just need a blog and a micro blog (indieweb: articles and notes), and I should have room for other posts like photos and book reviews.

So, I changed my <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> structure. Static pages, such as contact and now, stay the same. If it's a post, it'll be under `/p/{title}/`. Lastly, each post had a category page like `/blog/`. Under this new system, that'll be `/c/{category}/`.

Okay, that's a wrap on this article. Oh, one more thing. I set up redirects for my old posts. That's all. Thanks for reading!

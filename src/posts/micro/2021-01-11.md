I read [a post by Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/why-having-a-full-post-rss-feed-is-a-good-idea/) championing full-post RSS feeds.

I'm trying to think of ways to encourage people who use my RSS feed (if they exist ðŸ˜‰) to actually read the articles on my website.

Why? I work hard on my website.
* I try to be accessible at all times
* I aim for the optimal reading experience
* I design for aesthetics as well as simplicity

Mainly, though, my website represents _me_. It's the only coding project I've worked on steadily for the past three years.  It's been painstakingly redesigned multiple times, and I try to put flair and charm into each iteration. I care deeply about my website.

If you have any suggestions, please [let me know](/contact).

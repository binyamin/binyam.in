On Mastodon, <a href="https://matthiasott.com/" class="h-card">Matthias Ott</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/110033938136836091" class="u-in-reply-to">asked</a>, <q cite="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/110033938136836091">What information do you include in the README of a web project? Any great examples you can think of? Do you use a template? Or do you write them from scratch every single time?</q> I started drafting a reply, which broke Mastodon's character limit. So, now it's a blog post.

Anyhow, the structure of a readme often depends on the project, but there are some common points.

1. <p>At the top of the readme, describe the purpose of the project. Be stupidly simple. State the obvious.</p>
2. <p>If the readme is for a website, link to the live website. It's surprising how often people miss this part.</p>
3. <p>If the readme is for a library, document the API. Nothing complicated, just a bullet-list with some code examples. Typescript definitions (<i>typedefs</i>) don't count. And while code should be self-documenting, it doesn't need to be the <em>only</em> form of documentation.</p>
4. <p>It's often helpful to link to related projects. You give those projects the boost they need, and your users can make an informed decision about your project.</p>
5. <p>Maintenance info: Is this just a personal project, or are you looking for actively looking for pull requests? Can people expect a quick response to their issues, comments, and pull requests? We're all busy, so there's no judgement here.</p>
6. <p>For legal reasons, I <em>always</em> include a short note mentioning the license.</p>

That's my two cents. I also wrote [another shorter note about this topic](http://binyam.in/p/2021-08-11/). So that's like, 3 cents. Which is very cheap, in case you wanted to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Binyamin).

# About Me

My name is Binyamin Aron Green, and this is my website.

I am a [Jewish ‚ú°](#jewish) web developer and student from [Baltimore, Maryland üó∫Ô∏è](https://baltimore.org/). I enjoy [reading üìö](#reading), [listening to music üéº](#music), and [tinkering with this website ‚öí](#this-site).

You may be wondering what I'm up to [now ‚è≤Ô∏è](/now) in life.

## Jewish
I'm an orthodox Jew. Here are some of the implications.
- I place special importance upon the study of the _Torah_, or the collective of Judaism's traditions, laws, and practices.
- I strive to act like a [mensch](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mensch).
- I observe [the _Shabbos_](https://www.aish.com/sh/) (the Jewish day of rest) on Saturday.
- I keep _kosher_ ([article](https://www.aish.com/jl/m/mm/48958906.html), [video](https://youtu.be/vy43vWtAP0g)), so I adhere to certain dietary restrictions.

## Reading
I like reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, as well as philosophical works. You can look at [my reading list](/reading).

## Music
I began learning piano at age 6. When I sit down at the piano, I play whatever song is in my head. That's usually Jewish pop or a part of a movie soundtrack.

My Keyboard is a [YPG-235](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/portable_grand/ypg-235/), but Yamaha has discontinued that model in favor of the [PSR-EW300](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/keyboards/portable_keyboards/psr-ew300/). I also own a [Blue Yeti Nano](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti-nano/) microphone for recording.


## Writing
I've started a [journal](/c/micro), or _micro blog_. Sometimes, I write full articles and post them on [my blog](/c/blog). I used to maintain a [personal wiki](/wiki) of sorts. There are JSON and RSS [feeds](/feeds) for most of my writing.


## Code
I've been coding (I think) since late 2017. If it means anything, I joined GitHub on May 31, 2018. I primarily work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know some Python, and I studied Java in college.

### This Site
This website represents me, and helps me track my growth over time. I believe that personal websites are very beneficial for web developers, especially for beginners. I wrote about [how I built this site](/colophon), and I keep [a roadmap](/roadmap) for it. I store the source code both [on GitHub](https://github.com/binyamin/binyam.in) and [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/binyamin/binyam-in).

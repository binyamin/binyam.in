# Styles

{%callout "warning" %}
ðŸš§ **Work-In-Progress**\
This document is evolving slowly. It's not done yet. Things are rough around the edges, etc.
{%endcallout%}

This is my style guide. I also have [a colophon](/colophon), which explains what I used to build my website. This document talks more about the visual design.

<!--

## Voice & Tone

My "brand" is a visual representation of my personality and goals. I would like to exhibit formal, clean, and sensible. Another value I'd like to display is friendliness. I want to be kind, warm, and inviting. This dichotomy of logic and emotion influences all my decisions, and I want my brand to reflect that.

## Typography
- **Font stack** is just system fonts (sans-serif and color emoji)
- **Body font size** is usually 18px, and 16px on smaller screens

We really only use 3 levels of headings. This is largely for visual taste, readability, and the user's sanity. Unless you're writing an academic report, web pages generally aren't detailed enough to merit a 4 levels of headings. If you feel the need for a 4th level, try restructuring your content and/or using different components.


## Block-level Elements

> This is a blockquote

1. List

<figcaption>Technically, this is just a description.</figcaption>
</figure>

```js
function foo(bar) {
    return bar;
}
```

{% callout "info" %}
This is a callout. It can contain a lot of text; so much so that it continues on a new line.

Sometimes, you need another paragraph.
{% endcallout %}

<button class="btn">Button</button>

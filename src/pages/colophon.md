# Colophon
Last updated on {{ modified | pretty_date }}

This site began in early 2018, and the design has changed a lot over the years. The 2nd and 3rd iterations are [on GitHub Pages](https://binyamin.github.io/archives), just in case someone wants to see them. The current version was originally conceived in December of 2019, and implemented slowly over the following months.

I used [Figma](https://figma.com) to design the site. Figma is a web app, so you can open your files on any computer (including Linux). Plus, their free tier is perfect for my needs.

I decided on a minimalist design. I chose the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) font, and [a Minor Third type-scale](https://type-scale.com/?size=18&scale=1.200) at 18 pixels. I don't know much about typography, and type-scales seem professional. The accent color is always some variation of winter green.

In early 2020, I switched from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), because Eleventy uses JavaScript plugins. I examined a few free hosting services, and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) seemed the most powerful.

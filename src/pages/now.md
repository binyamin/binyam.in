<summary><strong>In the Past</strong></summary>

**Winter 2021**
* I'm pretty close to earning my Associate's Degree in Computer Science. Just a handful of classes left.
* I'm looking for work experience as a front-end developer.
* I started a ["micro" blog](/c/micro), as a way of lowering my pressure for writing. It's been sort-of successful.

**Fall 2020**
* I've given up on my writing goals. I'd like to focus on hobby-coding and school.
* I triage issues for [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy). GitHub notifications went from "pointless" to "overwhelming" rather quickly.
* We got a dog! His name is Wilson, and he looks like a matzo ball.

**Summer 2020**
* I'm trying to write more often.
* I'm taking French and Western History in College.
* I'm working at [Camp HASC](https://camphasc.org) this summer. Covid and everything.

**Spring 2020 (titled "Goals")**
* I'm trying to write an article every week
* I walk each day for about 10-15 minutes.
* This summer, I will be working as a lifeguard at [Camp HASC](https://camphasc.org)

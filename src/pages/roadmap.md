# 🚦 Roadmap
This page is all about the future. Of this website. Inspired by [Marc Jenkins](https://marcjenkins.co.uk/roadmap/).

- More animations <!-- maybe pointless -->
- Send Webmentions automatically
- ~~Client-side search~~ (costly and unnecessary)
- Display my spotify habits from the last month (wip)
- list site goals (roadmap page?)
- list personal goals (now page?)
- collect & display bookmarks
- show posse links for articles
- blogroll
- redesign blockquotes, and style included citations specially
- ~~switch from [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) to [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) (smaller, faster, better-documented api)~~ too complicated
- ~~minify HTML~~
- code-block titles
- make [/style](/style) page into a comprehensive styleguide
- hebrew/french versions of site
- auto-generate json/rss feeds for each collection (pagination?)
- use [parse5](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5) to post-process html (deal with external link rels, heading anchors, etc.)

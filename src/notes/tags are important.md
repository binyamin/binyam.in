# Tags are Important

Lately, I've been thinking about Mind Gardens 🌱. Specifically, I've been exploring the idea of internal navigation through hashtags.

If you don't know what a mind garden is, skim [“You and your mind garden”](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) by Anne-Laure Le Cunff.

If your wiki is your digital brain, it should mirror the way you recall information. So, how do you think?

When I remember something, it's not because I looked it up in some mental thesaurus 📖! I associate the memory with something, and that association was triggered. It's kind of like a tag.

Now, I can still find memories when they're needed. If an association is triggered, I automatically look for related thoughts. In other words, I can "search" for a "tag".

Note: I specifically used the word "tag" and not "backlink".
If I have twenty notes relating to spicy-food, a tag would automatically link all future notes, whereas a backlink requires you to manually reference the new note in a previous one.
